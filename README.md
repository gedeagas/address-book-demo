# Basic Contacts App

## Introduction

This is the most *basic* of contact apps. It is a project I started last year and am looking to finish up next summer. It is basically just some HTML, Bootstrap, and vanilla JavaScript.

Once I get comfortable with vanilla JavaScript and have worked my way through the Advanced Front-End and Backend projects at Free Code Camp, I will add some Node.js and Postgres.

For now it is a place to store and search a small database of contacts, or an address book.
