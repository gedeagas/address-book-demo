## Introduction

This is the most *basic* of contact apps. It is a project I started last year and am looking to finish up next summer. It is basically just some HTML, Bootstrap, and vanilla JavaScript.

Once I get comfortable with vanilla JavaScript and have worked my way through the Advanced Front-End and Backend projects at Free Code Camp, I will add some Node.js and Postgres.

For now it is a place to store and search a small database of contacts, or an address book.

## Usage examples

This is just for practice. If you're a newbie, you could fork this and improve upon it. It isn't a traditional "open source" project. It is just something for me to showcase what I am learning. If you are learning to, *fork it!*

**Disclaimer**: *App is still in the very early stages*. I am working on it but not as frequently. I plan to get it done by the end of next year's summer break.

## Development setup

I test with Travis CI. To set that up, make a `package.json` and use either Yarn or npm:

```shell
npm init
```
or with yarn,

```shell
yarn init
```
both will make a `package.json` file in your root directory.

Then you make the Travis CI YAML file: 

```yaml
language: node_js
node_js:
  - "6.3.1"
```
## Contributing

I am not expecting a lot of contributions. But if you *do* contribute, fork the repo, and submit a pull request. I will be adding feature branches in the near future.

Keep it to vanilla JavaScript or jQuery for now. Still learning the basics. No frameworks, no matter how much better it will make the app. Still working through school and Free Code Camp so in time there will be more features.

## Release history:
24 alpha releases but those were really for the shields.io badges. üòè
